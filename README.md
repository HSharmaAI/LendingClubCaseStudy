# Loan Default Prediction using Exploratory Data Analysis

## General Information
This project aims to understand the driving factors behind loan defaults by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. The objective is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default, which can be used for making informed decisions regarding loan approvals.

## Business Problem
The business problem this project addresses is twofold:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about past loan applicants and their repayment status. It includes consumer attributes and loan attributes which influence the tendency to default.

## Conclusions
- High loan amounts and low annual incomes are associated with higher default rates. Applicants with higher loan amounts and lower annual incomes tend to default more often.
- Certain loan purposes, such as debt consolidation and small business, are associated with higher default rates.
- Employment length and grade also show significant patterns in default rates. Longer employment length and higher loan grades correlate with lower default rates.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
